			<p>LiAngelo Ball is the second son of LaVar and Tina Ball, and is part of the infamous Ball brothers. He followed in Lonzo's footsteps and went to UCLA college after finishing at Chino Hills, playing for both their basketball teams. LiAngelo finished high school as the fourth-leading scorer in CIF-SS history, with 2,918 career points, quite an impressive feat.</p>
			<p>Unfortunately, on November 7, he was arrested in China for stealing sunglasses from a Louis Vuitton store along with a few of his teammates. They could've faced time in prison, but were released from custody and the charges against the players were dropped. As a consequence of this situation, LiAngelo was suspended from UCLA's basketball program.</p>
			<p>Now LiAngelo has signed to play with the Vytautas Prienai–Birštonas in the LKL along with his brother LaMelo Ball. He has recently declared that he is going to try and enter the 2018 NBA Draft. Unfortunately, after losing another game LaVar has confirmed that he would take the two out of the team and have them return to the United States instead of finishing the season out in Lithuania.</p>
