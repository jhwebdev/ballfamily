			<p>LaVar Ball is the father of three basketball players: Lonzo, LaMelo, and LiAngelo Ball. He was born on October 23, 1967 and met his wife, Tina, at Cal State Los Angeles. LaVar played both basketball and football at high school, and moved on to play at a college level. He was briefly even a practice squad member for the New York Jets and Carolina Panthers, though he never played an official game.</p>
			<p>LaVar is also the founder and CEO of his own company, the Big Baller Brand. It is a sports apparal company that also sells his sons' signature shoes, causing big brands to decline to sign endorsement deals with them. This company has raised a lot of critisms like how overpriced the merchandise are. Additionally, LaVar started the Junior Basketball Association. This league is an alternative for high school players that don't want to move on to college.</p>
			<p>He came to the media's attention when he began saying that he could beat Michael Jordon one-on-one and other similiar statements. LaVar also had a little quarrel  with Donald Trump, the President of the United States. Trump stated that he helped LiAngelo and his teammates out of going to prison for stealing in China, though LaVar disagreed.</p>
